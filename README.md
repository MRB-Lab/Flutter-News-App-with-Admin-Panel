News Hour is a complete news app with an admin panel that is developed on the Flutter framework developed by Google. It works on both android & iOS. It has all the common and special features that a typical news app has. We have used lots of animations to make this app user-friendly. It could be able to satisfy users with impressive UX design and smooth performance on both iOS and Android devices. If you are looking for a news or blog app for both iOS and Android, News Hour could be the best option for you.
